### Working on this... [OpenGL Core]


### Spectral Ray Tracer [C++]

* Implemented a full-spectral renderer in Dartmouth Introductory Ray Tracer, featuring D65 spectral light source, reflectance spectrum up-sampling, Monte Carlo color matching, and wavelength-dependent BRDFs
* Doubled the speed of the single-Monte Carlo algorithm using Hero-wavelength sampling technique

### Construction Site Scene Graph [Unity, C#]
* Developed innovative framework of construction site operator AI controller based on Finite State Machine that simulates automated multi-person interactions in a fenestration scene
* Collaborated with YKK AP to develop pipeline that converts motion captures to large scale synthetic animations with point cloud and scene graph ground truth
